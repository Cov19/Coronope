Crowdsourced Coronavirus vaccine proposal (Mirror)

This is a mirror of the Coronope proposal for a crowdsourced vaccine as seen in the original ReasonTV video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BTvVnOgc10). Please keep in mind, by mirroring this proposal doesn't mean we are in support of it or what he is doing. As he stated in the video, there could be less than a 50% chance of success the vaccine works. This is actually quite high, and who is to say he will work on it. Also, it is recommended you understand biostatistical data before injecting yourself with anything (if he was to make this readily available).

The mantainers of this org and many other researchers are willing to work on a Coronavirus vaccine as well, but through the legal route. If the FDA is willing to allow us, we can also work on open sourcing a vaccine as well or at the very least making protein synthesis data related to the Coronavirus public. This may even be true with an extent given current funding limitiations. That being said, we would only be willing to do this given the legal route.

Proceed with caution with companies and startups such as these. We don't want to take on any legal liability saying releasing a vaccine without FDA approval is okay. We are mirroring this data solely on the basis of spreading of information given it was already mentioned on ReasonTV amongst other places. Our goal is to be censorship-resistant, but limiting liability in our own right. Feel free to fork this or redistribute this repo or information as needed.
